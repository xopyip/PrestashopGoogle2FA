# XIP2FA
This is my first addon for Prestashop. 

Some time ago I want to add two-factor authentication to my store based on Prestashop, but unfortunately the cheapest
the addon with that functionality costs 50eur, so I do it by myself and now it is opensource ;)

## TODO:
- [ ] Implement own version of Google Authenticator API to remove calls to 3-rd party API
- [ ] Add permission-based option to manage other's 2fa security (in case of lost secret key etc)
